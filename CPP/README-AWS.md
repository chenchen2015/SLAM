`g3` instance seems not working on Ubuntu. I have struggled for a couple days setting up GPU driver and OpenCV with CUDA support, did not work!

Found that AWS had a [tutorial for setting up GRID virtual applications running on `g3` instances](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/building-a-gpu-workstation-for-visual-effects-with-aws/).
